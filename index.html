  <p>
    <a href="http://www.vimgolf.com/">VimGolf</a> is awesome, but like Vim 
    itself, the solutions can be a little intimidating in their cryptic brevity.
    <em>VimGolf Digest</em> aims to provide a guided tour of some of the cooler 
    solutions.

  <h1>About the Author</h1>

  <p>
    I'm your host, Dan Dorman. I've used Vim for several years, but I'm no Vim 
    hero. I've never coded a must-use plugin, or even crafted a custom color 
    scheme.

  <p>
    Some of the VimGolf solutions were just so clever that I felt compelled to 
    figure out how the real Vim wizards pulled 'em off. What I learned while 
    exploring these rabbit holes seemed like something worth sharingâ€”or anyway, 
    writing it down seems like it will crystallize some of this stuff so I can 
    use it when it will really help me.
